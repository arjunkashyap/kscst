                <p class="gText bquote">Motivated by the desire to build a strong base for practical problem solving in several engineering colleges as well as to build their R &amp; D potential, KSCST decided to promote student project programmes in a large number of educational institutions, located in Karnataka, in areas of engineering, medicine, fisheries and agriculture. It saw an enormous reservoir of talent and creativity in the students and the faculty of engineering colleges in Karnataka. KSCST, therefore, ventured into launching and implementing a programme, the Student Project Programme for providing financial and academic support for engineering projects.</p>
